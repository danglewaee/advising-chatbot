The operating system provides a well-known, convenient, and efficient interface between user programs and the bare hardware of the computer on which they run. The operating system is responsible for allowing resources (e.g., disks, networks, and processors) to be shared, providing common services needed by many different programs (e.g., file service, the ability to start or stop processes, and access to the printer), and protecting individual programs from one another. The course will start with a brief historical perspective of the evolution of operating systems over the last fifty years, and then cover the major components of most operating systems. This discussion will cover the tradeoffs that can be made between performance and functionality during the design and implementation of an operating system. Particular emphasis will be given to three major OS subsystems: process management (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping), file systems, and operating system support for distributed systems.

For theoretical computer scientists, QIS provides the means to unlock the ultimate computational powers available to us in this universe. For programmers and computer engineers, QIS offers the tools to run simulations and optimizations otherwise infeasible on classical computers. For theoretical physicists, QIS gives us hope of resolving paradoxes foundational to our understanding of Nature. And for experimentalists and engineers, QIS also enables the creation of exquisite sensors and novel communication tools, far outperforming what is classically permitted. This class will introduce the notion of quantum probability amplitudes, i.e., the \"correct\" probabilistic description of Nature, and describe how these quantum phenomena permit the creation of new types of computational machines. The introduction to foundational quantum information science will be followed by a few practical (and impractical) quantum algorithms, illustrating the counterintuitive computational powers of quantum mechanics.

More specifically, this course will introduce key health informatics technologies and standards, including electronic health records, medical claims data, imaging data, free-text clinical notes, patient-reported outcomes, traditional and machine learning-based analytic algorithms, data visualization, and clinical research and experimental procedures. Note, however, that the course is not designed to introduce new types of machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms for health-related data. This course is taught in the same classroom with students from COMPSCI 524. However, students enrolled in INFO 324 will be evaluated independently of students from COMPSCI 524. This course fulfills a concentration core requirement for the Health and Life Sciences track, and it can be used to fulfill an elective requirement for the Data Science concentration of the Informatics major.

Using the personal health informatics model, we will learn various challenges in designing technologies for personal health data collection (e.g., step count, heart rate, or food intake etc.), integration, self-reflection, and behavior change. Going further, students will understand design issues in sharing personal health data and discuss design guidelines for collaborative data collection, reflection, and care. It is difficult to create health technologies that can successfully be integrated into people s daily life due to many obstacles in individuals data collection, integration, self-reflection, and sharing practices. Understanding these challenges is an important part of designing Health Technologies. Therefore, this course will cover HCI and design thinking methods that students can leverage to understand the adoption and use of Health Technologies and to design effective Health Technologies. Moreover, visualizations facilitate people to gain insights from their data, so we will cover common visualization approaches used in the personal data contexts.

The operating system provides a well-known, convenient, and efficient interface between user programs and the bare hardware of the computer on which they run. The operating system is responsible for allowing resources (e.g., disks, networks, and processors) to be shared, providing common services needed by many different programs (e.g., file service, the ability to start or stop processes, and access to the printer), and protecting individual programs from one another. The course will start with a brief historical perspective of the evolution of operating systems over the last fifty years, and then cover the major components of most operating systems. This discussion will cover the tradeoffs that can be made between performance and functionality during the design and implementation of an operating system. Particular emphasis will be given to three major OS subsystems: process management (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping), file systems, and operating system support for distributed systems.

As legislators look to regulate these platforms and commentators propose shutting them down entirely, this course looks for an alternative: affirmative visions of social media that are good for individuals and society, which we could work towards building. This class examines possible problems with existing modes of social media, discusses ways in which social media could be a benefit to individuals and societies, develops case studies of successful and healthy online communities, and ultimately designs and builds tools to improve existing social media systems or replace them with novel models.

The course examines two primary themes: (1) the application of foundation models in multimodal biosignal sensing contexts, including real-time physiological monitoring, neural signal processing, behavioral understanding, and clinical decision support through wearable devices such as EEG headsets, smartwatches, smart rings, eyewear, and earables; and (2) the technical challenges and solutions for deploying these powerful models on resource-constrained devices, including model compression, efficient inference, on-device learning, and real-time processing requirements. Example topics will include: Application Domains in Health and Wearables, Systems Optimizations and Architecture, IoT Applications and Environments. The course will primarily consist of paper readings, presentations, and discussions.

The course begins with examining the core values of public interest technology, such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. We will then review foundational concepts around innovation and strategies, along with an overview of technology governance. An overview of product development models, focusing on Agile product development will be presented along with a presentation of tech governance within an Agile framework. We will then analyze case studies where technologies have either succeeded or failed to uphold these values, examining the societal impact of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving cars, digital platforms, and data-driven systems. Throughout the semester, guest lectures from leaders in the fields of technology policy, innovation, and governance will offer insights into how you can bridge the gap between regulatory goals and technological creativity in your future careers.

Quantum cryptography is one family of such tasks with the most famous one being quantum key distribution.

Such unconditional security cannot be achieved in the classical world.
