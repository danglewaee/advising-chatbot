COMPSCI 250: Introduction to Computation
David Mix Barrington and Mordecai Golin
Fall 2025
This is the home page for COMPSCI 250.
COMPSCI 250 is the undergraduate core course in
discrete mathematics and will deal with logic, elementary number theory,
proof by induction, recursion on trees, search algorithms, 
finite state machines, and a bit of computability.
The two lectures each day will be very similar and use
very similar lecture slides.  Lecture 250-01 (Dave) meets MWF 1:25-2:15
p.m. in Goessmann 64.
Lecture 250-02 (Mordecai) meets MWF 10:10-11:00
a.m., in Goessmann 20.  The sections will have the same homework and exams, and will use
a single Canvas site.
There are eight discussion sections each Wednesday:
250-01AB, 10:10-1100 a.m., Marston 220
250-01AC, 11:15 a.m.-12:05 p.m., Marston 220
250-01AD, 12:20 p.m.-1:10 p.m., Marston 220
250-01AE, 4:00-4:50 p.m., Marston 211
250-02AB, 11:15 a.m.-12:05 p.m., ELAB 325
250-02AC, 1:25-2:15 p.m., Marston 220
250-02AD, 2:30-3:20 p.m., Skinner 12
250-02AE, 1:25-2:15, Marston 15

General Information:
This course is primarily intended for undergraduates in computer science 
and related majors such as informatics, mathematics or computer
  engineering.
  CICS 160
(using data structures) and MATH 132 (Calculus II) are prerequisites
and are pretty strictly enforced.
The four-credit course meets for three lecture meetings a week, Monday,
  Wednesday, and Friday.  Each discussion will meet some time on
  Friday.
  The locations and times for the class meetings are listed above.The
  two
  lectures will be similar and will follow the
  textbook pretty closely.  Both lecture sections of the course will have
  the same assignments, exams, and grade scale.
The
schedule
below indicates which
  lectures and discussions happen which days, which sections of the
  book to which they refer, and when the homework assignments are due.
There is one discussion meeting per week for each of the nine
sections, at various times on Wednesdays as indicated on
  SPIRE.
 Each discussion will have a written assignment which you
will carry out in groups.
Discussion attendance is required,
so that missing a discussion
  will incur a grade penalty. The TA's and instructors will cover the sections
  in various
combinations, 
so they will be as interchangeable as we can make them.
The textbook is the first edition of Dave's in-progress book,
A Mathematical Foundation for Computer Science
.  This
will be available as an e-book from
Kendall 
Hunt Publishing
, but do
not
buy the "Revised Preliminary Edition", as it will not include the
correct
assessment package.  The correct information should be up there soon.
The book has an "assessment
  package" where you will need the current version of the book to
  answer quiz questions.  The book and package
  can be obtained from the eCampus site or
  directly from Kendall Hunt.  (Dave does not get royalties for
  purchases from students in the course -- they are contributed
  to the
David Mix
Barrington Scholarship in Computer Science
.)
The course is using the Canvas course
  management system and the Piazza system for student discussion.
  We will also use a free system called
ClassQuestion
, which replaces
  the iClicker system we used in prior years.  They will be used in grading only
  for classroom attendance.
  Basic information about the course will be on this
site, and specifics of the course will be off of the Moodle main page
once it is established.

Announcements (8 August 2025):
(8 Aug) The preliminary course page is going up today.  Not much is changing
  from the Spring 2025 offering of the course, and the main page for
  that offering is
here
.  Note that the TA
  and
  UCA listings are currently the most recent I have available for
  Fall 2025,
  but some will probably change.
  The first class is 3 September, but remember that there are
  no discussions on the first day -- the first discussion is 10
  September.
